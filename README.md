# Paddle_Game_in_JS
It is a small paddle game and my first try on web game development.
Paddle game was a fun experience.

I used `Codesandbox.io` website and its online IDE for making the game.

**#INSTRUCTIONS**

- First of all, install all the dependencies by `npm install`
- After the dependencies are installed, do `npm start`, and `parcel` will build and start index.html file in your browser.
So you can play the paddle game!

**Enjoy!!! :)**
